# Easy CouchDB data modelling

CouchRest is composed of two libraries; [couchrest](/couchrest/index.html) a low-level driver used to provide basic access to CouchDB via HTTP requests, and [couchrest model](/model/index.html) an ActiveModel based data modelling framework specifically tailored for easy access to your database.

To get started, you'll probably want to have a look at the [couchrest model introduction](/model/index.html). This will help you access CouchDB from your rails project and get you modeling in a few short steps.

*NOTE:* This documentation is based on the 1.1.0 release of couchrest and couchrest model made on the 25 of June 2011.
